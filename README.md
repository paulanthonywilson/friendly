# Friendly - Coding Exercise

This project is a solution for a simple coding exercise.

Typically in an internal application I would link to background and business specifications. I am not doing that here as this is a public repo, while the exercise purpose is proprietary. 

It is set up for development. Actual deployment is out of scope.
